Hello, and welcome to group 41's Splitty app!

In order to run our project, just run the Main class in server/src/main/java. This will also launch the admin interface.
In order to run the client interface, run the Main class in client/src/main/java.

You can find our implementation of websockets in:
- server/src/main/java/api/EventController
- server/src/main/java/scenes/EventOverviewCtrl
- server/src/main/java/utils/ServerUtils 

You can find our implementation of long polling in:
- server/src/main/java/api/EventController
- client/src/main/java/utils/ServerUtils
- client/src/main/java/scenes/OverviewCtrl

Enjoy! - Team Elf
